#### Pulse Finder Bot

Pulse Finder Bot is a modular bot designed to parse and process website data. The bot supports multiple sources, proxy management, and automated deployment.

#### Features

- **Modular and Extensible**: Parse and process data from multiple sources with ease. New sources can be added when needed.
- **Proxy and User-Agent Management**: Mimics regular user behavior by rotating IP addresses and using custom User-Agent headers.
- **Integration with MongoDB**: Parsed URLs and data are stored in dedicated collections (`urls` and `vacancies`).
- **Remote Data Transfer**: Uses gRPC to send parsed vacancy information to a remote host.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Production-ready deployment on Vultr using Terraform.
- **Automated Testing**: Integration tests are executed via GitHub Actions.
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Enforces linting rules using `.golangci.yml`.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: A structured approach to maintainability and clarity in code.
